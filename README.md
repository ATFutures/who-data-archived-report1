Data for [`who` repo](https://github.com/ATFutures/who). These are
pre-processed with routines from the
[`popdens`](https://github.com/ATFutures/popdens) package, which must be
installed for this to work. It’s all `makefile` based. Files for
[`worldpop`](http://www.worldpop.org.uk) must be manually downloaded -
see specific `[city]/worldpop` directories for details. These are
national level `zip`-archived files which need to be cropped to the city
level only, and are converted to `geotif` format. This can be done, and
all OSM data also downloaded into corresponding directories with a
single `make` call. Alternatively, the components can be executed with

    make osm
    make worldpop

Note that `make osm` will always overwrite any existing OSM data,
whereas `make worlpop` will only convert files if they’ve not already
been converted.
